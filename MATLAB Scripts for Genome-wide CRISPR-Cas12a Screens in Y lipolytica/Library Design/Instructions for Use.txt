Design of CRISPR-Cas12a genome wide library in Y. lipolytica CLIB89 strain:

The algorithm for library design along with nontargeting sgRNA that act as negative controls is split into 5 parts:

(1) Import of all Chromosomes and protein coding CDS from these chromosomes.

(2) Design of Cas12a sgRNA for Top and Bottom strands for each full chromosome, as well as each CDS.

(3) Testing sgRNA designed for each CDS for uniqueness (to minimize off-target cutting).

(4) Generation of a strand-unbiased 8-fold coverage sgRNA library.

(5) Generation of non targeting sgRNA (negative controls).


To generate this library, please execute the scripts in the following order:

(1) Gene_Import_Cas12a.m
(2) Cas12a_sgRNA_finder.m
(3) Cas12a_Test_for_Uniqueness.m
(4) Create_Library.m
(5) Generate_Nontargeting.m

Note: The output of Gene_Import_Cas12a.m which is simply a list of all the CDS and chromosomes in CLIB89 is provided as the MATLAB variable Output_Gene_Import.mat. Importing this variable means that one can start directly from th second script.
